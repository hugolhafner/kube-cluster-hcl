      Deployments to a Kubernetes cluster with multiple availability zones often need to
      distribute those replicas to align with those zones to ensure site-level failures
      do not impact availability. This policy matches Deployments with the label
      `distribute=true` and mutates them to spread Pods across zones in a best effort fashion,
      scheduling nodes anyway if the constraint is unable to be fully satisfied.
